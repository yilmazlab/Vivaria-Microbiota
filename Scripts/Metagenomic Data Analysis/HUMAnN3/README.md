This directory contains data and scripts designed for the precise and efficient profiling of microbial metabolic pathways and molecular functions derived from metagenomic sequencing datasets. The tools and methodologies employed aim to facilitate high-resolution analysis of microbial community functionality.

All individual scripts used in the analysis are included in the `Scripts` folder, and the corresponding data can be found in the `Data` folder.

The data presented in this manuscript are tabulated in the main paper and the supplementary materials. All sequencing data generated in the preparation of this manuscript has been deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) BioProject database under accession number [PRJNA1049650](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/), with the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) submission ID: SUB14023600.
