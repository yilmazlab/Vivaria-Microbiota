This folder contains example scripts designed to assist in the analysis and visualization of 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing data as described in the manuscript. These scripts demonstrate how to process the data, generate figures, and extract key metrics such as taxonomy and alpha diversity from phyloseq objects.

The 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing dataset, including processed files and detailed sample information, can be downloaded from the README.md file on the main page of this repository.

Please note:
- No new code was developed specifically for this study; the scripts provided here are examples of standard analysis workflows.
- Some statistical analyses, such as comparisons of alpha diversity or other metrics, were performed using GraphPad Prism v10 after exporting data from the phyloseq objects.

These scripts are intended to serve as a guide for replicating the analyses and figures presented in the manuscript.
